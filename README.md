# nosql-database-backup-script
NoSQL Databaase Servers backup scripts like redis,mongodb

### warning:

These scripts are the first version and have only been written and have not yet reached the 100% test stage.
They may have an error related to the structure or even one line of them may not be executed because they are not yet developed enough and it is necessary to update these scripts more than this to be comprehensive.
However, I would be grateful if you who use these files on your server and test them, write me the errors and problems so that I can complete my scripts faster and easier.

### Change variables on script files

### Run script : 
```
sudo python3 file.py
```
### Requirements

### Task for future
